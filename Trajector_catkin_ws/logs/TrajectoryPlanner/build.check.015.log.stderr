  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target TrajectoryPlanner
  because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/opt/ros/noetic/lib]
    dir 1 is [/home/guocp/ä¸‹è½½/opencv-4.5.1/build/lib]
      dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [libopencv_gapi.so.4.5]

      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libcv_bridge.so]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libopencv_calib3d.so.4.5]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
